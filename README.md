Docker image for ISC DHCP server
================================

[![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/networkboot/dhcpd.svg)](https://microbadger.com/images/networkboot/dhcpd "See more networkboot/dhcpd image details")

This Docker image is suitable for running a DHCP server for your docker host
network.  It uses ISC DHCP server which is bundled with the latest Ubuntu
LTS distribution.

!!! Archived !!!
================

As I've switched over to ISC KEA DHCP server for my local network,
and ISC is in the process of no longer maintaining the ISC DHCP server,
I've decided to archive this repo and no longer maintain it.

Good bye, and thank you for all the fish!

How to build
============

 1. Install Docker with the instructions on <https://www.docker.com>.
 2. Run `./build` to create the local docker image `networkboot/dhcpd`.

How to use
==========

The most common use-case is to provide DHCP service to the host network of
the machine running Docker.  For that you need to create a configuration for
the DHCP server, start the container with the `--net host` docker run
option and specify the network interface you want to provide DHCP service
on.

 1. Create `data` folder.
 2. Create `data/dhcpd.conf` with a subnet clause for the specified
    network interface.  If you need assistance, you can run
    `docker run -it --rm networkboot/dhcpd man dhcpd.conf` for a description
    of the configuration file syntax.
 3. Run `docker run -it --rm --init --net host -v "$(pwd)/data":/data networkboot/dhcpd eth0`.
    `dhcpd` will automatically start and display its logs on the console.
    You can press Ctrl-C to terminate the server.

A simple `run` script is also included which makes it quick to iterate on a
configuration until you're satisfied.

DHCPv6
------

To use a DHCPv6-Server you have to pass `DHCPD_PROTOCOL=6` as enviroment variable

`docker run -it --rm --init -e DHCPD_PROTOCOL=6 --net host -v "$(pwd)/data":/data networkboot/dhcpd eth0`


Notes
=====

The entrypoint script in the docker image takes care of running the DHCP
server as the same user that owns the `data` folder.  This ensures that the
permissions on the files inside the `data` folder is kept consistent.  If
the `data` folder is owned by root, dhcpd is run as the normal dhcpd user.

If you forget to run the docker container with the `--net host` option a
warning will be emitted informing you that you've probably forgotten it.

If a `/data` volume is not provided with a `dhcpd.conf` inside it, the
container will exit early with an error message.

An additional Dockerfile has been added that allows building an image with
the tag `:ldap` which contains the **isc-dhcp-server-ldap** package in
addition to the normal DHCP server package.  Other than that it behaves in
exactly the same way as the `:latest` tag.  Utility build and run scripts
have also been added to work with this variant.
